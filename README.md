## The Requirements

* Laptop
* Web browser
* â˜• (optional, but recommended)


## Get Started ðŸš€

1. [Create an account](https://csdms.rc.colorado.edu/hub/signup) on the CSDMS JupyterHub
2. Provide a username and password - it can be whatever you like
3. Wait for authorization
3. [Get the tutorials and sign](https://csdms.rc.colorado.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Flandlab%2Ftutorials&urlpath=tree%2Ftutorials%2F&branch=v2_dev) in to our JupyterHub


## Before the workshop

1. **Sign up for an account (see above)**: We will do all of our computation on the CSDMS JupyterHub. This means that we wont' have to spend time installing software during the workshop. 
2. **Review the basics of working with Python and the Jupyter Notebook Interface**: There are many online resources. Coding experience is not a prerequisite for this workshop and we will explain core concepts as we go along. 
3. **Background reading**: Read the [Hobley et al., 2017](https://www.earth-surf-dynam.net/5/21/2017/esurf-5-21-2017.html) open source paper about Landlab
